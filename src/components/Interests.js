                Like a lot of people on this field, I love tech and most thing related to it, from computer components to VR, or even the basics, like how transistors and LED's work.<br/> I also love gaming, mostly RPG's (the old school ones, like Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy) and survival. When not gaming, I am probablly watching some series with my girlfriend or going to the beach with friends.
